        Mellowtech Core is a developer library that myself and Rickard CÃ¶ster
        started to work on in 2002. Mellowtech Core is a set of components that
        we use for doing disc and byte based manipulation of Objects. It is
        typically useful for any scenario that involves storing and sorting
        large amounts of Objects (in the millions) on disc. Mellowtech allows
        for consistent and fast disc based object retrieval. The library is
        being actively developed.

      >
        Diary writing is something that many people engage in and is a very
        important tool to keep track of the important things. In this project we
        were looking at ways of enhancing the diary writing process by adding
        contextual and temporal information into the diary itself. By tapping in
        to things a person is doing on the phone together with bodily sensor
        data we allowed people to reflect on what was happening at certain
        points in time. The Diary itself was developed using C# on a tablet and
        Windows Mobile. The project was later commercialized into a product
        called Affective Health.

      >
        Mobitip was an early example (2005) of a location based mobile app for
        recommending places - such as restaurants and shops. It was developed on
        - at that time the only true smart phone OS - Symbian and used bluetooth
        to automatically exchange recommendations between people that were close
        to each other. The recommender system itself was a hybrid
        centralized/decentralized one allowing it to function while not being
        connected.

        Kalas was a very early recommnender system - similar to Amazon's:
        "people who bought this book also bought. The difference being that we
        created Kalas back in 2000. I developed the back end and client parts of
        Kalas as part of my PhD thesis work. In this project we also did
        extensive user studies to find out how and what triggers people to use
        recommender systems or more generally engage in social navigation. Kalas
        is the Swedish word for party.
