        mellowtech came into existence back in 2002 when Martin Svensson and
        Rickard CÃ¶ster (then 2 phd studends) decided to start a software
        company. A great deal of time was spent on finding a good name, in the
        end we ended up with mellow - we thought it captured what we were about.
        A lot of relaxing and at the same time producing solid (actually another
        name we had in mind) and mature code. As with many other grand ideas
        running a company while doing your phd did not turn out to be the best
        of ideas, especially since we mostly wanted to create cool stuff.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        In the end one the company died but the idea of mellowtech prevailed. It
        has been a playground for fiddling with things such as, disc based
        search and sort, key-value stores, social graphs, oauth & openid and
        blog sofware. Some of it has lived for a very long time while other
        stuff have been developed recently.
